This component has the height of its parent, please have a wrapper div around it if you need to set size
this is done so we can set relative position of the arrows to be in the middle while not messing with the overall size of the component
if the overall size of the component changes as we have more lines of text in the descrption, when we need to center this component it will giggle up and down
the arrows are set to 45% bias from the top of the outer most container
